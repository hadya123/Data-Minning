Machine learning modelling
The aim of this project is to develop machine learning models that can predict death of a patient as result of heart failure on the basis of several clinical . The dataset has been picked up from here

Three Code Files are included in this repository. The file HEART FAILURE PREDICTION.R contains the R programming language code for a Knn machine learning model. 
The .R file of HEART FAILURE EDA contains the explolatory data analysis conducted on the 12 predicing cinincal indicators of heart failure alongwith visualization conducted for the EDA.
The third file contains the decision tree model developed and tested on heart failure data, alongwith with various methods that lead to improvement in the accuracy of the model performance indicators.
